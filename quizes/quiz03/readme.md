There are two files X.py and Y.py  corresponding to Train X Test X and Train Y and Test Y

How to run:
use any IDES to run X.py and Y.py separately to get the output.

X.py is not an efficient algorithm which aims only to get the correct output.

Y.py uses a much better algorithm to pre-process the data into dictionary by using 
the label as key. This algorithm will be 100 times more efficient if we have more than
1 million rows of data.
